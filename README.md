# i_am_rich app

My first flutter app that just displays an image of a diamond.

If you want to test the app on your android device , you need to clone this repo in your system
and you should have flutter environment installed , then run the command "flutter build apk --split-per-abi"
then you have to install 'app.apk' file located in
"build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app.apk".
