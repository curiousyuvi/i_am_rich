# i_am_rich app

My first flutter app that just displays an image of a diamond.
I have given the apk file so you can download and test it in android device.

NOTE- One thing to note that you may think that the file size of apk(48.87 MB) is ridiculously high 
for an app that just displays an image but the thing is that in the IDE with flutter there are so 
many useless code already present to help new developers and with my current skill level I do add not 
know which file I can remove, otherwise the apk file size would had been a lot less.
